# linear-regression-modeling
End-to-end linear regression project using Python and scikit-learn. Includes EDA, data transformation, model training, and evaluation using R² and RMSE. Well-documented notebook with visualizations and insights, suitable for portfolio or stakeholder review.

DESCRIPTION
This project showcases a complete workflow for building a robust linear regression model using Python and scikit-learn.

Overview
The notebook includes exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation. The objective is to uncover meaningful relationships in the data, apply appropriate transformations, and build a model that provides accurate predictions.

Key Components
Data Exploration: Visualized relationships between key variables and formulated/tested multiple hypotheses

Data Preparation: Applied transformations based on EDA insights to improve linearity and model fit

Modeling: Implemented a linear regression model with scikit-learn

Evaluation: Assessed model performance using R², adjusted R², RMSE, and residual analysis

Visualization: Included plots for model fit, residuals, and predicted vs actual values

Conclusion: Summarized insights, explained feature choices, and discussed limitations and improvement areas

The notebook is written as a professional report with clear markdown documentation and well-commented code, making it suitable for technical review or stakeholder presentation.
