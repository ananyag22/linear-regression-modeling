# Linear Regression Model - Wine Quality
This project demonstrates the complete pipeline for building and evaluating a linear regression model using the Wine Quality dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains physicochemical properties of red wine samples, along with quality ratings given by human tasters.

## Dataset Source:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv

## Overview
The goal is to predict wine quality based on various chemical attributes using a linear regression model. The project includes detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), data transformation, model fitting using scikit-learn, and thorough evaluation using visual and statistical metrics.

## Key Steps:
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualized relationships, identified outliers and patterns, and tested hypotheses about feature relationships.

### Data Preparation:
Applied transformations (e.g., normalization, interaction terms) where needed to improve linear model performance and assumptions.

### Model Development:
Implemented and trained a linear regression model using scikit-learn, with clear reasoning for feature selection.

### Model Evaluation:
Assessed model accuracy using R², adjusted R², RMSE, and residual analysis. Included plots such as actual vs. predicted, residual distribution, and model fit.

## Insights and Conclusions:
Summarized key findings from the model, discussed limitations, and proposed future enhancements or alternative modeling approaches.

## Tools & Libraries:
- Python (Jupyter Notebook) </br>
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for data analysis and visualization </br>
- scikit-learn for regression modeling and evaluationuitable for technical review or stakeholder presentation. </br>
